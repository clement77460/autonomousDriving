projetScala

[Scala] - School project 

the goal of this project is to analyze data in real time. These data such as temperature, oil [...] come from autonomous cars. 

So we thought about a KAFKA and SPARK STREAMING solution to collect the data that were sent by each car.

After that, we are able to apply a spark script to analyze every data and find reasons why cars are falling down.
